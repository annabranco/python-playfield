# Basic Python exercises

This is just a repo with very basic python coding, as part of my learning of this great language. All exercises but _test.py_ were written by me.

- test.py
this is a very very basic exercise with strings and numbers

- test0.py ❤️
  this is an exercise using argv and records names on an eternal file (names.txt).
	You may initiate it using an opitional name
	`python3 test0.py`
	or
	`python3 test0.py Anna`

- test1.py
this is a basic exercise fooling around with local and global variables.
	Like _test0_, you may initiate it using an opitional name or not. It not, it gives  default value for argv.
		`python3 test0.py <Anna>`

- test2.py
this is a basic Class exercise with and without constructor

- test3.py
this is a basic exercise using dictionaries and lists. It doesn't print a thing.

- test4.py
this is a basic exercise using module imports. It prints _test3_.

- test5.py ❤️
this is a more throughout exercise using Class and inheritance. I really like this one!
